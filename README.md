## Introduction

Sales prediction is a critical task in business analytics, allowing companies to make data-driven decisions for inventory management, marketing strategies, and more. In this project, machine learning algorithms are used to predict future sales based on historical data, product features, and other factors.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project includes features such as:
- Product ID
- Store ID
- Date of sale
- Advertising expenses
- Previous sales figures
- Other related features (you can add more details about your dataset)

If you're using a public dataset, you may want to include a link to the source.

## Project Structure

The repository contains the following files:
- **Sales_Prediction_using_Python.ipynb**: The main Jupyter notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, make sure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- The following libraries:
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - scikit-learn
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn

You can install the required libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Sales-Prediction.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd Sales-Prediction
```

3. Open the Jupyter notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook Sales_Prediction_using_Python.ipynb
```

## Usage

In the notebook, you will find:
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing data, encoding categorical variables, feature scaling, etc.
2. **Model Selection**: Training models like Linear Regression, Random Forest, or other regression models.
3. **Model Evaluation**: Assessing the performance of the models using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.
4. **Predictions**: Using the trained model to predict sales for future data.

You can modify the code and experiment with different machine learning models or parameter tuning to improve performance.

## Model and Results

- Various machine learning models are trained and compared for their accuracy in predicting sales.
- Visualization of the predictions and actual sales figures is included to analyze model performance.
- The final model is evaluated based on its accuracy and error metrics.
